# go-starter

This project functions as a starter for any webapp. It uses the stack

- Gin Web Framework
- HTMX
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS

For Bundeling, Minifying and Compiling TS to JS I use Webpack.
It also uses Docker. There is a make file which starts the whole stack in development and production mode.
